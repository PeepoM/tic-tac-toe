# About
Tic Tac Toe implementation using Haskell. My first ever game written in a functional language.

# Sources
The Minimax algorithm was implemented with guidance from chapter 11.10 of prof. Graham Hutton's book Programming in Haskell 2nd edition. The chapter takes a close look at the under the hood workings of the algorithm itself and its usage in the game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
